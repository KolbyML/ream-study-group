# Ream Meeting #3 Recap

## Overview

The Ream developers' call gathered an international group of participants to discuss key topics related to L1 networking, P2P stack, and future implementation strategies. Manas provided an overview of L1 networking, highlighting the Disc v5 protocol, gossip sub protocol, and network changes for Data Availability Sampling (DAS). The discussion progressed to the nuances of Ethereum Name Records (ENR), attestation subnets, and potential performance enhancements in gossip protocol.

A consensus emerged to explore ZK virtual machines (VMs) and post-quantum cryptography in subsequent sessions, with Jun agreeing to present on ZK VMs. The meeting also touched on the ETHProofs project and its relevance for benchmarking ZK VMs. Action items included preparing pre-reading materials, sharing meeting recordings, and arranging introductions for further discussions on P2P topics and cryptography.
