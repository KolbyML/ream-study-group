# Ream Meeting #4 Recap

## Overview

In the recent Ream developers call, Jun Song (@syjn99) introduced the concept of zkVM, discussing its key components, including compilers, provers, and verifiers, while underscoring the importance of understanding its architecture and instruction set. The team explored the current market landscape for zkVMs, with RISC-V emerging as a leading architecture, and emphasized the necessity for performance benchmarks. Further discussions delved into the implementation details, particularly focusing on the performance of SP1 and RISC0, alongside insights on verification processes and efficient hashing. The role of zkVM in consensus mechanisms was also addressed, highlighting the need for lightweight validation. Moving forward, participants planned the next meeting to center on Winternitz and the importance of documentation, while concerns about project dependencies and licensing were discussed, ensuring most are under permissive licenses. Action items included sharing research resources, preparing presentations, and coordinating future meeting logistics.
