# Ream Meeting #2 Recap

## Introduction

- Agreed on weekly study group format for consensus specs, technical, and Beam chain topics.
- Discussed plans for building skeleton structure for Ream, before the Beam Chain specs are released. Building out services like p2p and peer discovery early
- Update weekly call time to 2:30pm GMT from 3:30pm GMT to better accommodate different time zones

## Study Group and Development Planning

- Next week @hopinheimer will present on the current P2P layer and Libp2p implementation of the Beacon Chain
- Discussed the need to understand current beacon node architectures
- Explored the relationship between beam chain and current EL&CL implementation
- Discussed the use of zkVM in beam chain implementation
- Clarified that Beam Chain replaces the current day Beacon Chain CL, not EL

## Technical Aspects of Beam Chain

- Discussed the differences of zkVM vs zkEVM. A zkVM would be used for state transition functions
- Explored replacing BLS signatures with Winternitz (post-quantum resistant)
- Identified three main components of exploration: P2P layer, zkVM for state transitioning, and cryptography

## Justin Drake's Input and Future Plans

- Discussed the transition process from Beacon to Beam chain
- Explored the handling of validator keys and potential changes
- Justin proposed monthly Beam Chain study group sessions starting next year
- Discussed the implementation of cryptography libraries for Beam clients
