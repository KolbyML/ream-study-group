# Beacon chain

Study materials on the Ethereum Beacon chain.

## Beacon chain specs
- [Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Consensus Specifications](https://ethereum.github.io/consensus-specs/) (2018 - current)
    - This is the official consensus specs. It consists of the base Phase0 specs followed by incremental changes per each upgrade.
        - **Phase0**
            - **The beacon chain**
                - Defines the necessary **data types, parameters, operations** (e.g. depositing, proposing, attesting and voluntary exiting), **state accessors** (e.g. get_current_epoch, get_block_root, get_beacon_committee) and **other helpers** (e.g. math, crypto, predicates)
                - Defines the **state transition function** (how to proceed from one block to another), **epoch processing** (e.g. epoch justification/finalization, randao mixes), and **block processing** (e.g. attestation, deposits, voluntary exits, proposer slashing, attester slashing)
            - **Deposit contract** - Defines the constants, config values, smart contract functions and event logs and reference to the actual implementation of the deposit contract.
            - **Beacon chain fork choice** - Defines how the chain selects a contentious block e.g. due to late arrival of the block, late attestations, etc.
            - **Honest validator guide** - Defines the responsibility of a validator, e.g. use of BLS public key, withdrawal credentials, committee assignments, how to propose a block, how to attest, how to aggregate attestations,
            - **P2P networking** - Defines how validators discover and communicate with each other.
                - TCP libp2p transport for both dialing and listening
                - libp2p-noise for secure channel handshake with secp256k1 for encryption
                - multistream-select 1.0
                - mplex/6.7.0 for multiplexing
                - discv5 for discovery
                - SSZ for serialization
                - Snappy for compression
                - Gossipsub v1 and v1.1 extension
            - **Weak subjectivity** - Defines how one creates and uses a weak subjectivity checkpoint for a faster chain sync
        - **Altair**
            - **Beacon chain changes** - Introduce sync committees. Increases penalty values for inactivity and slashing. Incentive accounting reforms to reduce spec complexity.
            - **Light client sync protocol** - Defines the new features required to support light clients. E.g, new configurations, new gossipsub topics and messages, new Req/Resp endpoints.
            - **Honest validator guide changes** - Defines changes to the validator behaviors to support sync committees. E.g. checking if a validator is assigned to the sync committees, aggregating sync committee signatures, incorporating sync committee signatures into block proposals, signing and broadcasting beacon block roots.
            - **P2P networking** - Defines the changes to the P2P layer to support sync committees e.g. changes to gossipsub existing topics and messages, changes to the existing Req/Resp endpoints, and adding a new bitfield to the discv5 ENR to facilitate sync committees subnet discovery.
        - **Bellatrix (The Merge)** - Prior to Bellatrix, the beacon chain runs in parallel to the Proof-of-Work chain and does not have transaction execution. The Bellatrix upgrade brought in transaction execution and completely phased out Proof-of-Work.
            - **Beacon Chain changes**
                - Increased penalty parameters (inactivity & slashing) to their final values.
                - Defines the configurations for the transition e.g. TERMINAL_TOTAL_DIFFICULTY
